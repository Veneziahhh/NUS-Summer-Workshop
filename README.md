# NUS-Summer-Workshop

## Real Time Graphics Rendering

The previous group project [Open_City](https://github.com/Veneziahhh/Open_City) enables me to master the basic knowledge of computer graphics and be able to render images based on the OpenGL framwork. Unfortunately, I have not been able to achieve ray tracing. So I chose Real Time Graphics Rendering as my learning track in NUS Summer Workshop the instance I heard we are supposed to program our own ray tracing system for the final group project.

as1/as2/as3/as4 are personal assignments, as5 is group project. I have done excellent work and I received [A+ performance](https://github.com/Veneziahhh/NUS-Summer-Workshop/blob/main/Performance%20Slip%20-%20t0925750%20-%20Duan%20Haoyi.pdf) evaluated by School of Computing, National University of Singapore!

Complete a Shadertoy GLSL fragment shader that implements the Whitted Ray Tracing algorithm, then model and render a new 3D scene by modifying the shader. Ranked 3 within 18 groups and won [Third Prize](https://github.com/Veneziahhh/NUS-Summer-Workshop/blob/main/SWS3005_ThirdPrize.pdf)!
